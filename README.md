# Alexis - Your Trusty Task Manager

Alexis is a CLI-based application that helps you manage your tasks. 
Tasks are split into todos, deadlines and events, and you can mark them as completed or not completed. 
There is also a function to quickly locate your tasks using a keyword, and also a function to locate tasks based on their dates.
The task list will be automatically saved into a .txt file on your PC, so a saved task list will be loaded when you start up the program,
and also the task list will be automatically saved into the .txt file when you exit the program.
